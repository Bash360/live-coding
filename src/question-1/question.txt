Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one. It returns true if it is a subsequence otherwise it should return false.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.

Term Definition:
A subsequence is a sequence of elements from a given sequence that preserves the order of the elements but may not be contiguous. For example, in the string "hello", "hlo" is a subsequence because the characters maintain their original order.

Example:
  [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9]
  [2, 34, 4, 19] form a subsequence of the array [12, 7, 2, 34, 5, 22, 4, 19]
  [5, 25, 22, 8] is not a subsequence of the array [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
