Write a function that accepts a string containing brackets e.g {}[]() and returns true if the string contains balanced brackets and false if otherwise.

A balanced bracket is one that has an opening and a corresponding closing pair.

Example:
  '([]{}())' is considered balanced
  '[]{}()' is considered balanced
  '[]{}()' is considered balanced
  '[[[[{{}}]]]]()' is considered balanced

  '[[' is considered not balanced
  '}])' is considered not balanced
  '{(}}])' is considered not balanced
